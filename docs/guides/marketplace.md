# Marketplace

The Marketplace is the meeting place for sellers and buyers. Here you can display the items in your inventory that you wish to sell or trade. If you would like to add an item to the Marketplace, see the article [put an item up for sale](inventaire.fr/#comment-mettre-un-bien-en-vente)

## **How ​​to view the Marketplace?**

You can view a company's or individual's products in the Marketplace, accessible via the **Market** option on the home screen or from the dashboard's quick actions. You can also find your items there if you have published any.

## **How ​​do I search for an item in the Marketplace?**

In the Marketplace, you can search for an item or type of item in order to purchase it. You can use the search bar in the Marketplace area.

### *Search by keyword*

The search feature allows you to search for an item to purchase using a keyword. Perform a keyword search in the Marketplace.

1. Click on the Search bar.
2. Enter the word you are looking for in the search field.
3. The list of matching products will be displayed at the bottom.

### *Add a filter*

Adding a filter allows you to search for one or more items with common attributes. Filters are placed to the right of the search bar. You can apply one or more filters by selecting their value.

Note: If you are unable to find your item in the Marketplace, please contact [customer service](https://wa.me/+237698778055).

## *About Purchasing and Trading*

In the Marketplace, you can choose to either trade or buy.

### ***How ​​do I buy an item?***

When you buy, you pay a pre-agreed amount to obtain someone else's item.

1. Open the Marketplace
2. Locate the item you want to obtain
3. Press **trade** > **buy** > **submit**

### ***How ​​do I trade one item for another?***

Unlike buying, bartering requires you to have items in your inventory to exchange them for another.

1. Open the Marketplace
2. Locate the item you want to obtain
3. Press **trade** > **Make a trade**
4. Enter the name of the item you want to give in exchange and select it.
5. Click **submit**

> **Note**

> If the trade is accepted by the other party, you will receive a notification.

## **How ​​do I edit one of my items? ?**

To edit one of your items, you can either [view details](#view-an-item) of your item in the MarketPlace and press the **Edit** button at the bottom. Or you can [edit it in inventory](inventory.fr/#how-to-edit-item-information).
