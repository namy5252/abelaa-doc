# Inventory

The inventory is the space where all your belongings are listed. You can fill and empty it as you wish to know the value of your belongings and efficiently manage your possessions.

## How to view all your belongings

To view your assets in the inventory, go to the home page and tap "Inventory".

## How to find an item in the inventory

In the inventory, you can search for an item. You can use the search bar in the inventory list or directly on the inventory home page.

The search feature allows you to search all your properties using a keyword. Perform a keyword search in the inventory, or from the inventory list.

1. Click on the Search bar.
2. Enter the word you are looking for in the search field.
3. The property will be displayed at the bottom.

### *Add a filter*

Adding a filter allows you to search for one or more properties with common attributes. Filters are placed to the right of the search bar. You can apply one or more filters by selecting their values.

Note: If you cannot find your property, make sure you have entered it correctly or that you have not already deleted it from the inventory. If the name is correct, please contact [customer service](https://wa.me/+237698778055)

## How to list an item

When you add an item to your inventory, you have the option to publish it in the marketplace. All Abelaa users can see the listing and buy or trade your item.

Only you can see the contents of your inventory and decide what to list, but users will be able to see all the items you list in the marketplace.

To do this, you must [search](#how-to-find-an-item-in-the-inventory) for the item in your inventory and tap the three small vertical dots, then tap ***List for sale*** and confirm on the notification that appears at the top of your screen. Your item is now visible in the marketplace.

## How to edit item information

You can edit an item at any time after adding it (#how-to-add-an-item-to-your-inventory), and it will be instantly updated in your inventory and on the Marketplace if you already have it listed (#how-to-list-an-item-for-sale).

## How to delete an item from your inventory

In your inventory, hover over the item you want to delete.
Click on the three small vertical dots and on ***delete item***, then confirm the deletion.

> Note: Deleting an item is irreversible. Abelaa cannot recover items you have deleted. You can only recover deleted items by manually re-adding them to your inventory. Please note that if the item was already listed in the marketplace, it will not be deleted if you have already sold or traded it.
