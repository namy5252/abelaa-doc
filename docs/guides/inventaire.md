# Inventory

The inventory is the space where all your belongings are listed. You can fill it in and empty it as you wish to know the value of your belongings and efficiently manage your possessions.

## How do I see all my belongings?

To view your assets in the inventory, go to the home page and tap "Inventory".

In this inventory, you can see all the assets you have saved. If the list is empty, it simply means that you haven't added any.

## How do I list an item for sale?

When you add an item to your inventory, you have the option to publish it on the marketplace. All Abelaa users can view the listing and buy or trade your item.

The contents of your inventory are confidential until you decide to list it for sale, but users will be able to see all the items you list on the marketplace.

To do this, you must [search](#how-to-find-an-item-in-the-inventory) for the item in your inventory and tap the three small vertical dots, then tap ***List for sale*** and confirm the notification that appears at the top of your screen. Your item is now visible on the marketplace.

You can edit an item at any time after adding it, and it will be instantly updated in your inventory and on the Marketplace if you already have it listed there.

## How do I delete an item from my inventory?

In my inventory, hover over the item I want to delete.
Click on the three small vertical dots, select the ***delete item*** option, and then confirm the deletion.
