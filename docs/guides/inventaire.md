# Inventary

The inventory is the area where all your belongings are listed. You can fill and empty it as you wish to know your material worth, while efficiently managing what you own.

## View all your belongings

To view your belongings in the inventory, go to the home page and tap "Inventory."

In this inventory, you can see all the belongings you have saved. If the list is empty, it simply means you haven't saved any yet.
