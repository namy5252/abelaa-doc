# ASSET LISTING MANAGEMENT

Our marketplace allows users to list and sell their physical assets by creating individual listings.

## **What is an *Asset Listing*?**

An **Asset** represents the physical object itself.

An **Asset Listing** is a specific offer made by a seller for an asset. <br>
Multiple users can post listings for the **same asset**, and a seller can even create multiple listings with different terms.<br>
Therefore, the **same asset** can have **one or more listings**, each processed independently.

> Each listing is displayed separately on the marketplace, even if they are for the same asset.

### ***Example of an Ad Card***

> **Item**: iPhone 12 <br>
> **Seller Location**: Douala<br>
> **Quantity Available**: 1<br>
> **Transaction Type**: Sale<br>
> **Seller WhatsApp**: 678 000 111<br>
> **Wanted**: Negotiable<br>
> **Estimated Value**: 150,000 XAF<br>

## **How ​​do I get my ad to appear?**

Ads appear if they meet these conditions:

- The item is **published**.
- The item status is **commercial**.
- The item is of the **physical** type.
- The item has a **valid location**.
- The ad has at least **one unit available** (quantity – quantity ordered ≥ 1).
- The asset and the listing are not deleted (soft delete).

## **About Listing Ranking**

The marketplace ranks listings according to the following criteria:

- Assets recently viewed by the user are prioritized.
- Assets from sellers with similar business areas appear next.
- Other listings are then displayed, sorted by their publication date.

This ensures a more relevant experience for each user.

## **Listing Availability**

Each listing includes three values:

- **Quantity**: total number of units added by the seller
- **Quantity Ordered**: units already reserved or in the process of being purchased
- **Available Quantity** = Quantity – Quantity Ordered

When the available quantity reaches 0, the listing is automatically hidden.

## **How ​​Do Buyers Interact?**

Buyers can:

- View all listings for the same item
- Contact the seller via WhatsApp
- Place orders based on available quantity
- Read the specific details of each listing

Each listing is completely independent. Ordering from one listing does not affect the others.

## **When Should You Create Multiple Listings?**

A seller should create multiple listings when:

- The product is available in different cities
- They want to offer different prices
- They offer different types of transactions
- They want to target different groups of buyers
- They have multiple units sold separately
