# Registration

Creating an Abelaa account is the step that will allow you to take advantage of all the application's features and thus better manage your hidden assets.

At Abelaa, there are two types of accounts:

- ***Personal Accounts***

These are intended for people who wish to create their own inventories and sell their own items without being classified as a merchant.

- ***Business Accounts***

These accounts are intended for businesses, stores, or any other entities whose primary activity is the sale of goods and/or the provision of services.

## **Who can register on Abelaa?**

Abelaa is designed for individuals aged **18 and older**. If children under 18 wish to use Abelaa, a parent or guardian must set up and oversee their account, taking full responsibility for its activity, and ensuring all legal requirements are met.
