## **Our history**

ABELAA was born from an observation: no one is poor; everyone has potential.
In Africa, as elsewhere, the real challenge is not lack, but ignoring one's own wealth.
That's why in 2023 we created ABELAA, the application that helps everyone identify, leverage, and transform their potential into concrete solutions.<br>
Today, ABELAA is more than a tool: **it's a movement of trust, solidarity, and shared prosperity**.
