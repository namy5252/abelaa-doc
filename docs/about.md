# About ABELAA

## **What is Abelaa?**

Abelaa Uses a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**

Abelaa is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** to give users a fast, modern, and app-like experience without needing to download anything from an app store. A PWA lets us deliver the best parts of a native mobile app directly through the browser, while keeping the platform lightweight, secure, and accessible on any device.

With our PWA approach, users can:

Install Abelaa like a native app on Android, iPhone, tablets, and desktops—with just one tap.

Enjoy instant loading, even on slow networks, thanks to smart caching and offline-ready features.

Get a smooth, app-like interface with fast navigation, optimized pages, and background loading.

Receive real-time updates and notifications without installing a separate mobile app.

Experience consistent performance across all devices—no version conflicts or mandatory updates.


Using a PWA also means that every new feature, bug fix, or improvement becomes available immediately to all users, ensuring a unified, up-to-date experience for everyone on Abelaa.

In short, Abelaa’s PWA foundation lets us combine the reach of the web with the power of a mobile app, giving users a seamless, fast, and reliable marketplace experience—anytime, anywhere.

## **Our history**

ABELAA was born from an observation: no one is poor; everyone has potential.
In Africa, as elsewhere, the real challenge is not lack, but ignoring one's own wealth.
That's why in 2025 we created ABELAA, the application that helps everyone identify, leverage, and transform their potential into concrete solutions.<br>
Today, ABELAA is more than a tool: **it's a movement of trust, solidarity, and shared prosperity**.
